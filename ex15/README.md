# Exercise 15: Pointers Dreaded Pointers

## How to Break It

### Try to make cur_age point at names. Youâ€™ll need to use a C cast to force it, so go look that up and try to figure it out.

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){ 
    
    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);

    //first way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", names[i], ages[i]);

    //set up pointers to the start of the array

    int *curr_age = (int*)names;
    char **curr_name = names;

    //second way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(curr_name + i), *(curr_age + i));

    //third way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", curr_name[i], curr_age[i]);

    //fourth way of using pointers
    for (curr_age = ages, curr_name = names; (curr_age - ages) < count; curr_name++, curr_age++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *curr_name, *curr_age);

    return 0;
}
```

```
$ ./ex15
Omama has 11 years alive.
Zainab has 17 years alive.
Ali has 25 years alive.
Qureshi has 33 years alive.
Omama has -210673660 years alive.

Qureshi has 21987 years alive.
Omama has 11 years alive.

Ali has 25 years alive.
Qureshi has 33 years alive.
```
### In the final for-loop, try getting the math wrong in weird ways.

```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);

    //first way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", names[i], ages[i]);

    //set up pointers to the start of the array

    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;

    //second way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(curr_name + i), *(curr_age + i));

    //third way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", curr_name[i], curr_age[i]);

    //fourth way of using pointers
    for (curr_age = ages, curr_name = names; (curr_age - ages) <= count; curr_name++, curr_age++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *curr_name, *curr_age);

    return 0;
}

```

### Try rewriting the loops so that they start at the end of the arrays and go to the beginning. This is harder than it looks. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);

    //first way of using pointers
    for (int i = count-1; i >= 0; i--)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", names[i], ages[i]);

    //set up pointers to the start of the array

    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;

    //second way of using pointers
    for (int i = count-1; i >= 0; i--)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(curr_name + i), *(curr_age + i));

    //third way of using pointers
    for (int i = count-1; i >= 0; i--)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", curr_name[i], curr_age[i]);

    // //fourth way of using pointers
    for (curr_age = ages + count -1, curr_name = names +count-1; (curr_age - ages) >= 0; curr_name--, curr_age--)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *curr_name, *curr_age);

    return 0;
}
```

## Extra Credit

### Rewrite all of the arrays in this program as pointers.

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){ 
    
    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);

    //first way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(names + i), *(ages + i) );

### Go back to some of the other programs that use arrays and try to use pointers instead.

ex14

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

// forward declarations
int can_print_it(char ch);
void print_letters(char arg[]);

void print_arguments(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int i = 0;
    
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        print_letters(*(argv + i));
    }
}

void print_letters(char arg[])
{
    int i = 0;
    
    for (i = 0; *(arg+i) != '\0'; i++) {
        char ch = *(arg + i);
        
        if (can_print_it(ch)) {
            printf("'%c' == %d ", ch, ch);
        }
    }
    
    printf("\n");
}

int can_print_it(char ch)
{
    return isalpha(ch) || isblank(ch);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    print_arguments(argc, argv);
    return 0;
}
```

```
'e' == 101 'x' == 120 
```

### Process command line arguments using just pointers, similar to how you did names in this one.

using same code I used in last one

```
$ ./ex15 hello omama
'e' == 101 'x' == 120 
'h' == 104 'e' == 101 'l' == 108 'l' == 108 'o' == 111 
'o' == 111 'm' == 109 'a' == 97 'm' == 109 'a' == 97 
```

### Play with combinations of getting the value of and the address of things.


```c

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char *names[] = { "Omama", "Zainab" , "Ali" };

    int count = sizeof(names)/sizeof(char*);
    for(int i=0;i < count; i++ )
        printf("%d: value == %s position == %p \n",i,names[i], names + i);

    return 0;
}
```

```
0: value == Omama position == 0x7ffe23918750 
1: value == Zainab position == 0x7ffe23918758 
2: value == Ali position == 0x7ffe23918760 
```

### Add another for-loop at the end that prints out the addresses that these pointers are using. Youâ€™ll need the %p format for printf.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){ 
    
    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);

    //first way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", names[i], ages[i]);

    //set up pointers to the start of the array

    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;

    //second way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(curr_name + i), *(curr_age + i));

    //third way of using pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", curr_name[i], curr_age[i]);

    //fourth way of using pointers
    for (curr_age = ages, curr_name = names; (curr_age - ages) < count; curr_name++, curr_age++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *curr_name, *curr_age);

    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf(" name: %s : %p , age: %d : %p \n",names[i],names + i, ages[i],ages+i);

    return 0;
}
```

### Rewrite this program to use a function for each of the ways youâ€™re printing out things. Try to pass pointers to these functions so that they work on the data. Remember you can declare a function to accept a pointer, but just use it like an array.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void firstWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]);
void secondWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]);
void thirdWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]);
void fourthWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]);


void firstWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]){
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", names[i], ages[i]);
}

void secondWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]){
    
    //set up pointers to the start of the array

    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;

    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(curr_name + i), *(curr_age + i));
}

void thirdWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]){

    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;

    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", curr_name[i], curr_age[i]);
}

void fourthWay(int count,char *names[],int ages[]){
    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;
    for (; (curr_age - ages) < count; curr_name++, curr_age++)
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *curr_name, *curr_age);
}


int main(int argc, char *argv[]){ 
    
    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);

    //first way of using pointers
    firstWay(count,names,ages);

    //second way of using pointers
    secondWay(count,names,ages);

    //third way of using pointers
    thirdWay(count,names,ages);

    //fourth way of using pointers
    fourthWay(count,names,ages);

    return 0;
}
```

### Change the for-loops to while-loops and see what works better for which kind of pointer usage.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    int ages[] = {11, 17, 25, 33};
    char *names[] = {"Omama", "Zainab", "Ali", "Qureshi"};

    int count = sizeof(ages) / sizeof(int);
    int i = 0;

    //first way of using pointers
    while (i < count)
    {
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", names[i], ages[i]);
        i++;
    }
    //set up pointers to the start of the array

    int *curr_age = ages;
    char **curr_name = names;
    i = 0;
    //second way of using pointers
    while (i < count)
    {
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *(curr_name + i), *(curr_age + i));
        i++;
    }

    //third way of using pointers
    while (i < count)
    {
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", curr_name[i], curr_age[i]);
        i++;
    }

    //fourth way of using pointers
    while ((curr_age - ages) < count)
    {
        printf("%s has %d years alive.\n", *curr_name, *curr_age);
        curr_name++;
        curr_age++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
